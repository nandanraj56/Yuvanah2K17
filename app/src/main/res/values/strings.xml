    <string name="overview1">It gives us immense pleasure to introduce Yuvanah2k17, our third technical festival. As host of this techfest, we on behalf of Lakshmi Narain College of Technology, Indore, hereby invite you to embellish the most esteemed position in this technical festival by sponsoring this mega event. Yuvanah2k17, a two day national level annual techno-cultural festival, will be held from 26th – 29th April 2017. The festival will be an imposing event which will attract students from in and around Indore as well as from different states of India to compete on a big scale and showcase their talent. Since the last year’s technical festival, Yuvanah2k17, showed us 8000 registrations and won us appreciations from all over and thus, with a wider perspective and a lot more new ideas to be incorporated we are expecting much more participation this time.
The festival is a forum for minds to interact, share and discuss the new happenings in various fields of engineering and technology. Apart from the technical events which include various quizzes, presentations, lectures, group discussions etc., the festival will also host several non-technical events including gaming, fun zone, etc. The success of event depends enormously on the generous support of our sponsors to help fulfill our requirements. We invite you to participate as a sponsor of the event and be associated with event in a variety of ways including monetary funds, sponsor prizes, events, favours etc., to be recognized. Sponsorship package is outlined below. Other fund ideas and contributions are most welcome.</string>
